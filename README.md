# Happy Habits Behavior Tracker
--

### This repo is a WIP

An app to track good and bad behavior. This app will have the ability to set custom behaviors per child and assign weights to those actions. The user can assign multiple users to their device and track their behavior, either positive or negative on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

The app currently is local to their device only. We did have plans to eventually share data between devices and are actively accepting pull requests and feedback to do that. Ideally we would like to do this in either a server-agnostic function using something like IPFS + Ethereum or a paid model.
